On Free Speech
--------------

In addition to providing freedom of speech, the First Amendment – in conjunction
with the Fourteenth Amendment – provides for freedom of association (see NAACP v.
Alabama, 1958). Freedom of association is necessary for groups to freely express
themselves under the First Amendment.

As incorporated entities, social media platforms also enjoy freedom of
association. Social media platforms are not required to use their resources to
publish or amplify the speech of others. These platforms are free to publish
information that leads to profitability and enjoyment within their customer
base. They are free to refrain from publishing speech that may harm their
profitability or drive customers away.

Much progress has been made by Twitter (and, to a lesser extent, Facebook) in
asserting these rights in the interest of their shareholders. Unfortunately,
additional platforms now exist that are all too willing to harbor purveyors of
libel, slander, conspiracy theories, bigotry, racism, and cultism. While much
of this content is legal to publish, it is not ethical or moral to publish.

Social media companies aren't engaging in unconstitutional "censorship". You
are not being oppressed because a company exercises freedom of association to
bar you from using resources that they alone pay for. And if Parler wants to
be profitable, it will face a similar choice soon enough.

If you object to the dominance of major social media platforms, your remedy can
be found in antitrust law. It will not be found by creating a safe space for
the worst that humanity has to offer.
